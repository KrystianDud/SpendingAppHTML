App Idea and execution:



KNOWN ISSUES:

Line 83 - Blur is being disactivated after pressing the PLUS button and clicking outside of the box as inside of it.
Line 262 - Add expense does not allow to select category!
Line 344 - Category cannot be activated and therefore cannot be used in the stats chart.
LINE 476 - The class name is not changing to fit to the DIV


App has no function of adding past dates
Sidebar menu is currently not functional 

MISTAKES:

Many functions have been created inside the "addExpense" function, making it unfeasable to access them from outside.
To save the time I will need to create function similar in 80% to the existing one wasting resources.
